## Summary of Insights

  - Pizza sells the most during weekdays (Sunday and Saturday) and lowest every Tuesday
  - July had the highest number of orders followed by January, March, May and August, with the lowest in October.
  - Each pizza category sells almost evenly - Classic (27%), Supreme (25%), Chicken (24%), Veggie (24%)

  - Weekly restocking of supplies should be done a day or two prior the most selling day of the week (Sunday and Saturday)
  - Focus more on restocking monthly for the following top selling months - Januray, March, May, July and August
  - Consider adding another menu category (Meaty, Beefy, etc) to add more variety on the flavor.
